# Create a dictionary-based mini project in Python to manage an inventory in stock. The user should have options
# to add new items, buy items, change the price of items, and update the inventory of current items.
# There should also be a total sales variable that is initially set to 0. The project should handle inventory,
# price, and count. The project should be broken down into steps with clear instructions for each step.
# Each step should be pushed to GitHub.
# 1. Create a new GitHub repository and set up a new Python project.
# 2. Define the inventory dictionary to hold item data and a variable for total sales.
# 3. Create a `main` function to run the program and print a welcome message.
# 4. Create a function `add_item` to add new items to the inventory with a specified name, price, and count.
# 5. Update the `main` function to include a menu option for adding new items.
# 6. Commit the changes to GitHub.
# 7. Create a function `buy_item` to handle buying items from the inventory, updating the item count and total sales.
# 8. Update the `main` function to include a menu option for buying items.
# 9. Commit the changes to GitHub.
# 10. Create a function `change_price` to update the price of an existing item in the inventory.
# 11. Update the `main` function to include a menu option for changing item prices.
# 12. Commit the changes to GitHub.
# 13. Create a function `display_inventory` to print the current state of the inventory and total sales.
# 14. Update the `main` function to include a menu option for displaying the inventory.
# 15. Commit the changes to GitHub.
# 16. Create a function `update_inventory` to update the count of an existing item in the inventory.
# 17. Update the `main` function to include a menu option for updating the inventory count of existing items.
# 18. Commit the changes to GitHub.
# 19. Review and refactor the code if necessary. Add comments and documentation to explain the functionality.
# 20. Add a final commit to GitHub with any refinements and the completed project
